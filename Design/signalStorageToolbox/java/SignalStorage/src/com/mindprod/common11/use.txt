Includes:

ImageViewer:     component to display an image
Limiter:         cap, corral and hem methods to ensure a value in range.
Misc:            loadProperties (ordered), beep, thisYear, thisMonth, thisDayOfMonth
ResizingImageViewer: display Image allowing user to change magnification
Shuffle:         shuffles int[], similar to Colllections.shuffle(List)

BigDate is a replacement for Java Date class. Handles dates
999,999 BC to 999,999 AD, the missing year 0, the missing 10
days in 1582, and the switch to the 100/400 leap year rule
in 1600. Heavily commented Java source included. Supports
ISO WeekNumbers and ISO Day of week.  If you want do do
calculations on pure dates, ignoring timezones and time,
BigDate is much easier and faster than the Sun Date and
Calendar classes.  See TestDate for sample uses.

Why the hydrochloric acid molecule logo? Molecules are the
building blocks of matter. The library classes can be used
to build Java programs. Hydrochloric acid in 1 chlorine and
1 hydrogen. in the simplest possible molecule. The 1 theme
is supposed to suggest JDK 1.1.  Hydrochloric acid is pretty
nasty stuff, at least when concentrated. In weak
concentration it tastes a bit like lemon juice. The
connotation is unfortunate.  I hope you find these utilities
useful and most un-lemon like.

If you are using JDK 1.5+, get the com.mindprod.common15
package too.  It has more efficient implementations of some
of these same methods.
