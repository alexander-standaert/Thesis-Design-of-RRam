info: in the interface, points are added to a signal indicated by an index
This means that there is no simple way to immediately filter out signals
which are saved twice.

postfix includes "." at start

Therefore, the signals are saved twice and the readers of the output must support this behavior.


There is a 

Header           object -> filters out duplicate names
CompressedHeader object -> filters out duplicate names

 and a CompressedHeader object



New structure:

class Header used for both compressed and non-compressed
- can be used to request 
- filters out duplicate names
