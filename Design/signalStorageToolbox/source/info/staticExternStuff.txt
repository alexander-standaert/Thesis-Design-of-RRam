at global scope, static means the variable can be bound locally (cannot be overruled by external stuffies).

inside a function, static means that the variable is placed on the heap
and so the value is "remembered between different calls"

I have the impression that both unqualified and static are acceptable for
the global variables for UWI

problem was that it is not allowed to return 0 as wave number to ultrasim ( it is allowed for spectre )
