\usepackage{eurosym}


% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.



\usepackage{subfig}
% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  %\usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
  %\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
 %\usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
  %\usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
 %\let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
 %\renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
 \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
 \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Write abstract
A 1Mbit RRAM memory is presented. The focus lies on read operation, write operation has not been included in the design. Reference signal distribution can be modified by connecting reference cells in parallel. A bitline load has been chosen for maximum bitline voltage difference. Sense amplifier performance has been improved by allowing overlap between passgate-enable and latch-enable signals, this overlap gives rise to a nonlinear phenomenon, christened the RC-latch-effect. All Spectre simulations have been performed with 45nm PTM transistor models.

\IEEEPARstart{N}{on} volatile memories such as flash are widely used for mass storage devices, but are also steadily finding their way into the embedded domain. However, as discussed in \cite{Pra10}, it is getting difficult to fabricate reliable flash memories in DSM. It is argued that the scaling of flash-memories will not last for more than a few technology nodes. RRAM memories, in which information is stored in the resistive state of a memristor, would be able to scale indefinitely for now. Furthermore, the memristor fabrication can easily be integrated in a standard CMOS fabrication process. In this work, a RRAM memory has been designed, armed against intra-die variations which could degrade performance. 
First the general architecture, the way the 1T1R cells are put together, will be described. In the following section, load analysis results will be presented, in which an optimal load impedance is chosen for sufficiently large voltage differences for the sense amplifier and sufficiently low voltage drops over the memristor. Afterwards, the tuning of the reference voltage will be explained. Finally, some techniques for decreasing the offset voltage of the sense amplifier will be explained.


\section{General architecture}
The general architecture can be seen in figure \ref{fig:architecture}. The memory consist of 512 global blocks (GB). Each GB consists of two local blocks (LB), in which 32 bitlines (BL) and sourcelines (SL) and 32 wordlines (WL) are embedded.

\subsection{Branch}
In a branch 32 WLs are connected to as many 1T1R cells through the transistorgates. The memristors can be either HRS or LRS. The remaining memristor terminal is connected to a BL and the source of the transistor is connected to a SL. Besides these 32 data cells connected to 32 WL, there is also one reference cell in the branch, its gate is connected to the reference WL. At the top of the BL, the drain of a pMOS transistor is connected, its source is connected to the supply voltage. This transistor serves as a switchable load impedance. At the bottom of the BL, an nMOS transistor serves as switch to the ground voltage. An nMOS switch is also placed between the SL and the ground voltage. 


\subsection{Local block}
A local block (LB) consists of 32 branches combined as well as a BL \& WL decoder and passgates on the BL of each branch. The passgates are connected to the output node of the LB. To read out a data cell in a LB, the appropriate WL is brought to the supply voltage and the cell's BL-load/switch and SL-switch are turned on. A current will flow from the supply voltage through the load and cell (and SL-switch) to the ground voltage and a voltage will appear on the BL node. This voltage is passed to the output of the LB by turning on the passgate of that BL. Reference signals are generated by bringing the reference WL to the supply voltage and turning certain BL-load/switches and SL-switches on. The BLs are then shorted by turning on all the appropriate passgates.

\subsection{Global block} 
Two local blocks are brought together with a sense amplifier and its sample-and-hold switch in a global block (GB). If one LB produces a data signal at its output, the other will produce a reference signal and vice versa. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]

  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../fig/paper-architecture.png}
  \caption{Overview architecture}

\end{figure}

\section{Tuning the reference signal distribution}
It is assumed that certain elementary variables of components in the circuit have a normal distribution due to intra-die variations. These variables include the $\Delta_{V_{T}}$ and $\Delta_{\beta}$ parameters of transistors and the $\Delta_{R}$ parameter for the memristor. Due to these elementary variations, signals such as the data and reference signal also have a distribution. The distribution of the reference signal however, can be tuned. Recall that the reference signal is generated by shorting active BLs using passgates. Shorting a BL with an addressed HRS reference cell with a BL with a LRS reference cell would suffice for producing a voltage lying between a HRS data voltage and a LS data voltage. By using this shorting technique however the mean of the reference signal PDF would not lie exactly between the means of the HRS data PDF and LRS data PDF. By implementing more than 2 reference cells for the reference signal, and having more HRS (LRS) cells than LRS (HRS) cells, the mean of the reference signal PDF can be shifted. Furthermore, the distribution will have a smaller spread by implementing a bigger amount of reference cells. One should not implement too many reference cells however, since energy consumption (for each active reference cell, current flows through its corresponding bitline) increases drastically. In this design 16 reference cells in a LB are addressed for generating the reference signal, the remaining 16 serve as dummies. Of the 16 active reference cells, 6 are HRS and 10 are LRS.

\section{Load analysis}
Due to the aforementioned variations in the circuit, the data and reference signals should be designed as such that they are sufficiently far apart. After all the sense amplifier will have an offset voltage because of these same variations and the difference of its inputs must be larger than this offset in order for the SA to latch correctly. Besides designing the SA to have a small offset spread to realize this, the difference of its inputs can be widened by choosing a good load impedance. The load impedance not only influences the value of the data and reference voltages, it also determines the settling time of the charging of the BL and the voltage drop over the memristor. This drop can not be too high, destructive reads might occur because of this. As it turns out, fast settling is not compatible with low memristor voltage drop and large voltage difference. Because the latter are imperative for a functional memory and the former is not, settling time had no bearing on the final choice of load impedance.


\section{Sense amplifier overlap techniques}
The sense amplifier used in this design is the drain-input latch-type SA (see figure \ref{fig:ourSA}). Its input/output nodes are connected to the output nodes of the local block through complementary passgates. There are two ways to implement the latch timing cycle: one could separate the pass operation from the latch operation or could allow overlap between these two operations.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../fig/hfdstk-sensamp-ourSA.png}
  \caption{Drain-input latch-type sense amplifier used in this design}
  \label{fig:ourSA}
\end{figure}


\subsection{No overlap}
Using this control scheme, the SA would be separated from the local block when enabled. Offset voltage spread is mainly determined by the $\Delta_{V_{T}}$ and $\Delta_{\beta}$ variations of the differential pairs of the SA. These contributions can be decreased by increasing the sizes of the differential pair transistors. Sizing up the top and bottom transistor has not more influence on the latching speed rather than the offset voltage. There is also a maybe slightly surprising contribution on the offset voltage by the passgates. This can be explained by the charge injection of the passgates: when the passgates are turned on, the output voltage of the local block is passed on to the input/output node of the SA almost perfectly - whether there are variations on the transistors or not. When the passgates are turned off, a charge injection occurs on the SA input/output node - distorting the original voltage. The SA operates differentially though, so as long as this charge injection is matched at the two input/output nodes there would be no problem. $\beta$ mismatch of the passgate transistors however results in charge injection mismatch (see figure \ref{fig:chargeinjection}). Hence the contribution of the passgates to the offset voltage spread. This mismatch can be reduced by sizing up the passgates transistors. More charge is injected when the passgates are turned off, but the difference at the two sides is reduced.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../fig/hfdstk-sensamp-chargeinjectionmismatch.png}
  \caption{Charge injection mismatch due to $\beta$ variations of passgate transistors}
  \label{fig:chargeinjection}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Overlap}
If the passgates are still turned on when the SA starts latching, the voltage difference of the input/output nodes has not experienced charge injection mismatch. When the voltage difference has been sufficiently amplified, the passgates are turned off. Charge injection (mismatch) will occur, but it will not change the outcome of the latching anymore. During the overlap of the pass and latching operation, the passgates can be modeled by resistors. Neglecting the resistance of the passgates in the local blocks, the situation can be depicted as in figure \ref{fig:RC-latch}. CL is the bitline capacitance.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{../fig/hfdstk-sensamp-RC-latch.png}
  \caption{Simplified circuit when overlap between pass enable and latch enable is applied}
  \label{fig:RC-latch}

One could suspect that a large BL capacitance would significantly increase the latching time. While this is true for small values of R, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:RC-latch-sim}, for greater values the latching goes through two phases: during the first phase, it appears as if the big capacitance is decoupled from the SA. After this fast phase, settling is much slower.

  \label{fig:RC-latch-sim}
\end{figure}

This RC-latch effect arises when the RC-product is large. When it occurs, the capacitance behaves as a short-circuit and current flows through the resistor and a corresponding voltage drop over the resistor builds up. Afterwards the load capacitance charges itself at a much lower time constant.

\paragraph{}
The overlap between the enabling of the passgates and the SA thus needn't be this great: a load-less SA latching delay suffices. For this situation $V_{T}$ and $\beta$ mismatch of the ;passgate transistors results in mismatch of the resistors. The interaction between these resistors and the SA is strongly non-linear. Depending on the precharged values of the load capacitances, this R mismatch can result in incorrect latching. There is thus still a contribution of the passgates to the offset voltage spread. The interaction between R and the SA reduces the contributions of the differential pair mismatch however. For a minimal SA, the offset voltage spread is smaller with overlap than without. By sizing all the transistors, this spread can be arbitrarily reduced. The resistance of the passgates mustn't be too small however, or slow settling might occur. Then again, a large SA would probably charge the load capacitance effortlessly anyway.


\section{Read Throughput Results}
A read access time test was performed on the finished circuit (Figure \ref{fig:speedvdd}). In this test the vdd voltage was decrease and the maximum read throughput was measured. The test was performed at a (SPICE) temperature of $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. At each point in the shmoo plot, 100 MonteCarlo simulations were performed. The circuit has a read access time of 2.3ns at a vdd of 1V. during the read cycle, its energy consumption is 0.51pJ. Most of the energy (65\%) is consumed by the bitlines. 25\% of the energy consumption is used by the logic and the buffers en SA take the remaining 10\%. As the vdd voltage go's down, the read throughput also go's down. This is caused by a combination of phenomina. First of all the logic go's slower. This causes a timing issue where the bitline load is selected before the the cell is selected. The timing issue results in a rapid increase in bitline voltage which causes a longer setteling time of the bitline where the cell is eventually selected. A second reason for the decrease in read throughput at lower vdd, is the slower latching of the SA.

On figure \ref{fig:speedvdd} it can be clearly seen that the circuit can only operate upto a operating voltage of $0.8V$
